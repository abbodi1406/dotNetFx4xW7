# .NET 4.8/4.7.2 Repack Installer for Windows 7 SP1 x86/x64

* Repacked slim installer for .NET Framework 4.8/4.7.2 with latest updates integrated and without extra setup payload.

* Support creating slim updated installer for .NET 4.6 and later.

* Note:  
to rebuild/recreate *netfx_Full.mzz* file, you need to download [WiX Toolset binaries](https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/releases/download/wix3111rtm/wix311-binaries.zip)  
then, extract the files into **BIN** directory (you can delete the big sdk folder, it's not needed).

## Create slim main package:

* Place NDP*-ENU.exe file here next to the scripts (e.g. NDP48-x86-x64-AllOS-ENU.exe or NDP472-KB4054541-x86-x64-ENU.exe or NDP472-KB4054530-x86-x64-AllOS-ENU.exe).

* If exist, also place any updates exe files here (make sure to get files for both x86 and x64).

* Optional, edit *dotNetFx.cmd* and change the two options values (1 or 0):  
**BuildMzz**: Rebuild/Repack files inside *netfx_Full.mzz* instead administrative directories.  
**CompressMzz**: Create LZX high-compressed *netfx_Full.mzz*. helpful if 7z SFX will not be used.  
**ShowMsp**: Show slipstreamed patches in "Control Panel\Programs and Features\Installed Updates".  
**Single**: Create single-architecture repack. Set to `x64` or `x86`, or leave blank to create both.

* Run *dotNetFx.cmd* as administrator.

* Note: you may change **\BIN\NDP\DisplayIcon.ico** prior execution, if you want another ARP icon.

* Optional, use *7zSFX.cmd* to create 7-zip SFX executable installer afterwards.  
you will need to modify **\BIN\7zSFX\7zSD.sfx** module with resource editor to update and set product name and version.

* Available command line switches:  
```
/y  
Passive mode, shows progress but requires no user interaction.  
/ai  
Quiet mode, no user input required, only extraction dialog is shown.  
/ai /gm2  
Quiet mode, no user input required or output shown.  
/sfxlang:  
Set the program display language, if possible. Example: /sfxlang:1031  
/h | /?

Examples:  

Automatically install package and display progress:  
NDP472-Slim-x86-x64-ENU.exe /y  
Silently install package and display no progress:  
NDP472-Slim-x86-x64-ENU.exe /ai /gm2
```

* If you previously created 7z.SFX installer (main or langpack), move it to another location before attemping to use/run **dotNetFx.cmd** again.

## Create slim languages packages:

* Place NDP*.exe files inside **LP** directory (Recommended to put all lang files, or you may put only specific languages).

* Run *dotNetFxLP.cmd* as administrator.

* Note: you may change **\BIN\NDP\LP\DisplayIcon.ico** prior execution, if you want another ARP icon.

* Optional, use *7zSFX.cmd* to create 7-zip SFX executable installer afterwards.  
you will need to modify **\BIN\7zSFXLP\7zSD.sfx** module with resource editor to update and set product name and version.

* Available command line switches:  
```
/y  
Passive mode, shows progress but requires no user interaction.  
/ai  
Quiet mode, no user input required, only extraction dialog is shown.  
/ail
